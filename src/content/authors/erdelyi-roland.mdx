Welcome to my digital corner! My name is **Erdélyi Roland**, I'm a **junior-level software engineer** enthusiastic about the world of web development. As I navigate the early stages of my career, I find joy in the challenges of creating engaging web applications and the continuous journey of honing my coding skills.

Armed with a foundational understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **React** and **Next.js**, I'm passionate about contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of software development. Recently, I've embarked on a journey into **DevOps** and **automated testing**, broadening my expertise to ensure a holistic approach to software engineering. I approach each project with curiosity and a commitment to learning, eager to absorb insights and refine my craft.

When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll likely find me exploring new development paradigms, collaborating with peers, and seeking mentorship to accelerate my growth. I'm excited about the opportunities for innovation that lie ahead and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals in the tech community.
