I'm **Erdélyi Roland**, a dedicated university student with a passion for web development. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at **Eszterházy Károly Catholic University** in **Eger, Hungary**. I'm also a **test automation engineer** at [**Abesse**](https://abesse.hu/), an IT company based in **Budapest, Hungary**.

Armed with a foundational understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **React** and **Next.js**, I'm passionate about contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.

My recent foray into **DevOps** and **automated testing** reflects my commitment to a **holistic approach** in this ever-evolving landscape. Eager to absorb insights and refine my craft, I approach each project with curiosity and dedication. Let's embark on this journey of continuous learning and innovation together!
